        "description": "Remi began making resin products having been sat feeling unproductive and fed up with the Covid-19 pandemic. A new hobby was needed after many failed attempts at finding a muse, including guitar (my poor neighbours). She first stumbled across resin on Instagram and began to research a list of products that were needed. When payday came around, Remi purchased the basics and the first cake stand was created! The reaction on her social media was really positive, therefore, she decided to really give resin a go! 8 months later and here we are. Lila Harz now has many products from coasters to tables.",
